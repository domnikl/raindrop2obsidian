# raindrop2obsidian

A highly opinionated tool to help transfer highlights from raindrop.io to a format compatible with Obsidian.

## What you'll need

Go to https://app.raindrop.io/settings/integrations and create a new app. Generate a test token for it and set an environment variable `RAINDROP_ACCESS_TOKEN` for it. You can also use a `.env` file to provide it:

```shell
RAINDROP_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxx
```
